the reason I write c++ like writing in c is because the creation of c++ is
based on the idea of adding more feature on c, so I did

make everything modular, then that everything is used by something, kind of like
the manager

on player.cpp, posz is a rectangle type containing the width, height, x, and y

the collision is implemented in the main.cpp file, the collision handled by the
collisionwithpong() function

on pong.cpp, the bordervertical() function is to kind of like, bounce off the
pong if its hit the window top up and down border but not the side
